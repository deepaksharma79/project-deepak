# Fraud Detection System

A machine learning-based fraud detection system designed to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

## Overview

This project implements a fraud detection model that analyzes transaction data to flag suspicious activities. The system uses machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as legitimate or potentially fraudulent.

## Project Structure

- `fraud_detection.py` - Main Python script containing the fraud detection model
- `fraud_detection.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and model development
- `dataset.csv` - Training/testing dataset with transaction records
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Features

- Transaction data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model for fraud classification
- Performance metrics and evaluation
- Data visualization and analysis

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deepaksharma79/fraud-detection-using-machine-learning.git
cd fraud-detection-using-machine-learning

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Python script:
```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

### Using the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
```

## Current Limitations

⚠️ **Important Notice**: This model is not 100% effective in its current state. The detection accuracy has room for improvement, and there may be:
- False positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud)
- False negatives (fraudulent transactions not detected)
- Performance variations across different transaction types

**Future improvements planned:**
- Enhanced feature engineering
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Ensemble methods and advanced algorithms
- Improved data preprocessing techniques
- Increased training dataset size and quality
